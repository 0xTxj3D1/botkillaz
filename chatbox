bedlam: deadass a ghetto chatbox so we can all communicate until we determine a mutual option for comms and such. I vote relationlabs chatbox. minimal plus itll help build everyones profile on there which will in turn kick start the integration idea. Let me know what other ideas you all may have. also going to actually finish setting up my discord server eventually so thatll be an option for comms plus ill have a bunch of good info feeds including alphabots, any and all comms from consensys ceritek etc, and any other cysec related and alpha related bots/feeds. will be dedicated channels for heywallet cctip nano and coinkit plus any others like this i/we find along the way. looking forward to everything i intend to learn, making new connections, sharing knowledge i have, and most importantly doing our part to bring these scam rings down! much love for even being here yall for real!

TL:DR LFG!!!! lol IMPORTANT!!!!! ISO a FREE method to compile MANY csv and txt files and organize them into a relation web graph. or maybe a script to do it and some help with doing it all as im newb king over here!
